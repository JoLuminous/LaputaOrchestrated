# LaputaOrchestrated
A fan edit of "Castle in the Sky". In a way, this serves two purposes. One: a person whose never seen the original film before can watch it without feeling confused about the lack of music. Two: those who have seen the original film, and prefer it to the dub, but also like the new music, can have a compromise that satifies their need.
