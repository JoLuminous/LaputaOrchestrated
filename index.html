        <p><i>Castle in the Sky</i>, or <i>TenkÅ« no Shiro Rapyuta</i> as it is known in Japan, is a wonderful anime film that needs no introduction. As someone who only got into watching anime within the last few years, I can say that it is one of my favorites, for its music, characters, and overall themes (which are qualities shared by a lot of Ghibli films). However, a point of contention within the fandom relates to the dub done by Disney in the early 2000s, which added extra lines and more music to various scenes. While some absolutely despise this dub, I actually have grown to like it, and at this point, it is has become my primary way of watching the movie. However, a "problem" arises when you go back and forth between the two versions, as it is easy to notice where things are added for the dub, that seem almost missing, despite them not being there in the original. That leads into this project of mine.</p>
        <h3>The English Dub Soundtrack</h3>
        <p>One of the things added in the english dub of <i>Castle in the Sky</i> is a new orchestrated soundtrack by the orignal composer Joe Hisashi. I've read online that many purists dislike the additional music that was added in certain scenes as a result of this new soundtrack. Personally, I tend to disagree. While I understand the idea of silence providing ambience and focus in various scenes throughout the movie, I also feel that the new soundtrack simply upgrades an already great soundtrack. On top of that, as stated earlier, the orginal composer was involved for the new soundtrack, so why complain about more Hisashi? The more the merrier, I say.</p>
        <p>That said, watching the original movie feels rather jarring at first, without the additional soundtrack that is added in certain scenes. For example, the motif given to the military in the new soundtrack is pretty good, and gives the evil force more of a compelling image, but when taken away, you sort of miss it (or at least, I miss it). So that brings us to my project.</p>
        <h3>A Compromise</h3>
        <p>Wouldn't it be great to watch <i>Castle in the Sky</i> with its original Japanese dub, while also having the new soundtrack? That was the question that spurned this effort that took around two days to complete. I wanted to be able to watch the original japanese version of the movie, while also having the Disney dub soundtrack to accompany it. In a way, this serves two purposes. One: a person whose never seen the original film before can watch it without feeling confused about the lack of music. Two: those who have seen the original film, and prefer it to the dub, but also like the new music, can have a compromise that satifies their need.</p>
        <p>If this fan edit displeases you, I understand. You don't have to like what I've created, but just know this was done out of love for all versions of the film. That includes the original Japanese, the weird 1980s English dub, and the early 2000s Disney dub. I like all of <i>Castle in the Sky</i> and this was purely for fun (as well as a bit of curiosity).</p>
        <h2>Overall Changes</h2>
        <p><i>(This fan edit comprises only a few big changes. Nothing visual-wise was tampered with, only audio was altered. See changes below.)</i></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The English dub soundtrack was overlayed atop the Japanese vocals.</li>
          <li>The sound effects from the original japanese dub were retained.</li>
          <li>The robot soldier scene retains its original music (as there was not much of a difference between those particular tracks).</li>
          <li>The ending scene (where Pazu and Sheeta wave goodbye to the pirates) retains its original music (as there was not much of a difference between those particular tracks, and leaving the original intact provides a smooth transition into <i>Holding You</i>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is a comprehensive list of the methods I used to make this fan edit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An HD MP4 video file of the original Japanese dub (with English subtitles) was used for getting vocals and visuals.</li>
          <li>An HD MP4 video file of the Disney dub was used to get the new soundtrack, and also served as a guide for music placement.</li>
          <li>Note: I own a blu-ray of <i>Castle in the Sky</i> that contains both the Disney dub and the original Japanese dub. Only view/download fan edits when you have already owned or purchased a legal copy of the film.</li>
          <li>An Apple Music playlist of the Disney dub soundtrack was used to fill in places where the Disney dub audio source was muffled.</li>
          <li><a href="https://ultimatevocalremover.com">Ultimate Vocal Recorder (UVR)</a> was used to isolate Japanese dub vocal tracks and Disney dub music tracks.</li>
          <li>Isolated vocal tracks were overlayed with the Disney dub audio/music tracks to create seamless music transitions and prevent muffling. Some music tracks from the original Japanese dub were left intact (see above list).</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Downloads</h2>
        <P><i>Note: Before you even look at any of the download links on this page, consider whether you have a legal copy of</i> Castle in the Sky <i>in your possession. Fan edits should only be viewed if you have a legal copy. Plus, this movie deserves a lot of credit. If you don't have a copy, go buy one, so you can show Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki, and the other animators who worked on this film your love for their creation.
